# BETA
This repository is an app marketplace for Cosmos. It is directly converted from the CasaOS app store.

# How to use

Go to your Cosmos dashboard, click on the marketplace, then sources, and add the following URL to the app store URL input box:

```
https://lilkidsuave.github.io/asteroidsinthecosmos/index.json
```

# Disclaimer

Unlike the original Cosmos marketplace, this contains the CasaOS/RunTipi/TinyActive/LilKidSuave setup of the apps. This means things may not be 100% functional as of now.
