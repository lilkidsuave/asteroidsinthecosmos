    "longDescription": "<p>browserless is a web-based service that allows for remote clients to connect and execute headless work; all inside of docker. It supports new libraries like Puppeteer and Playwright, aiming to replace antiquated or in-house systems. We also bundle numerous handy REST-based APIs for doing more common actions like data collection, PDF generation and more.</p>",
    "description": "The docker image that powers the core of browserless is available for free for open-source projects. Using it is about as simple as using the browserless service itself with the only difference being that you'll have to launch and manage the infrastructure.",
